# RVTN SACS 7th grade project:

This was the code for my 7th grade final stem project. The code is a littke junkey, but my team, RVTN SACS won best in code that year, and the teacher was so impresed, she showed the whole grade. We learned how to do things that wern't taught, like the LCD Screen, and the Push Button. but, dont ask abot how the robot looked... (That was not my job, Don't blame me!)

Writen useing an Arduino Mega in the early school year of 2021.


# GBG Corp. 8th grade project:


We were tasked with creating a game of our desighn. we decided to make one for 3-11 year olds called "Hello, Beaver!". (File with the instruction manuel coming soon) Thohg it was far from perfect, it looked alot better than the 7th grade one that is for shure!
