# RVTN SACS project:

This was the code for my 7th grade final stem project. The code is a littke junkey, but my team, RVTN SACS won best in code that year, and the teacher was so impresed, she showed the whole grade. We learned how to do things that wern't taught, like the LCD Screen, and the Push Button. but, dont ask abot how the robot looked... (That was not my job, Don't blame me!)

Writen useing an Arduino Mega in the early school year of 2021.
