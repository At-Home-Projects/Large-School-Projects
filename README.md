# RVTN SACS 7th grade project:

This was the code for Comrade Bacon's 7th grade final STEM project. Though the code is a littke junkey, Comrade Bacon's team, RVTN SACS, won best in code that year. The teacher was quite impresed, the code was shown to several classes. We learned how to do things that wern't taught (for bonus that year), like the LCD Screen, and the Push Button. but, dont ask abot how the robot looked... (That was not Comrade Bacon's job, Don't blame him!)

Developed useing an Arduino Mega in the early school year of 2021-2022


# GBG Corp. 8th grade project:


We were tasked with creating a game of our desighn. we decided to make a game oriented for 3-11 year olds called "Hello, Beaver!". (File with the instruction manuel coming soon) Though it was far from perfect, it looked alot better than the 7th grade one that is for shure!
